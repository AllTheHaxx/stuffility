Please read the following carefully:

This is an a pre-release built for testing purposes, it may
contain bugs or crash at certain circumstances, althought
it should be pretty stable.
If you find a bug anyway, I'd be grateful if you report it
by creating an issue in our GitHub repo:
 https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx/issues

If there might be something that you want to discuss in
realtime, you can join the IRC at quakenet.org: #AllTheHaxx

If you want to create lua scripts yourself, read the
Lua Manual shipped with the client before asking dumb questions please :)

You may also be interested in the website, but keep in mind
that it was made weeks ago, so all the contents is pretty
outdated. We'll update it sometime :)

IMPROTANT NOTE: Although this client is called "AllTheHaxx",
it doesn't contain any cheats or bots! You shouldn't use bots!
The client is opensource, so guaranteed to be 100% secure and
free of harmful code. If you like to participate, you are welcome :)

Since this is a pre-release testing version, I highly recommend that
you don't wait for the official builds (which are very unfrequent)
You go much better if you clone the git repository and compile yourself.
A 'git pull' every two days will make sure that you're always
running the latest version.
Anyway, there is an auto-updater since beta13 which should make your
life easier what updates concernes :)

IMPORTANT NOTE TO THE USE OF LUA SCRIPTS:
We are not responsible if you get banned from a server because of
any annoying lua script you might use!
We are also not responsible if you use a lua script which was not
approved by us that causes harm to your computer or your cat!

And now, there is only one thing left to say:
Have fun! :D
