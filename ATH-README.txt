WARNING ABOUT PEOPLE SELLING LUA SCRIPTS
If anybody wants to sell lua scripts to you, DON'T give them your money!
Make sure to contact us first, since there are betrayers around who want you to
pay them for scripts that are freely available from us. Make sure not to be taken
by such assholes and don't hesitate to talk to us! (skype:henningstone)
I can give you almost every script for free that you could buy there!

Please read the following carefully:

This is an a pre-release built for testing purposes, it may
contain bugs or crash at certain circumstances, althought
it should be pretty stable.
If you find a bug anyway, I'd be grateful if you report it
by creating an issue in our GitHub repo:
 https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx/issues

If there might be something that you want to discuss in
realtime, you can join the IRC at quakenet.org: #AllTheHaxx

If you want to create lua scripts yourself, read the
Lua Manual shipped with the client before asking dumb questions please :)

You may also be interested in the website, but keep in mind
that it was made weeks ago, so all the contents is pretty
outdated. We'll update it sometime :)
 https://allthehaxx.github.io

IMPROTANT NOTE: Although this client is called "AllTheHaxx",
it doesn't contain any cheats or bots! You shouldn't use bots!
The client is opensource, so guaranteed to be 100% secure and
free of harmful code. If you like to participate, you are welcome :)
 https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx/pulls

Since this is a pre-release testing version, I highly recommend that
you don't wait for the official builds (which are rather unfrequent)
You go much better if you clone the git repository and compile yourself.
A 'git pull' every two days will make sure that you're always
running the latest version.
Anyway, there is a (working) auto-updater since 0.18 that should make
your life easier as far as updates are concerned :)

IMPORTANT NOTE ON THE USE OF LUA SCRIPTS:
We are not responsible if you get banned from a server because of
any annoying lua script you might use!
We are also not responsible if you use a lua script which was not
approved by us that causes harm to your computer or your cat!

And now, there is only one thing left to say:
Have fun! :D
