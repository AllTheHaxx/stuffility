IMPORTANT NOTES ON THE UPDATE TO >= 0.22
------------------------------------------

To get AllTheHaxx updated to any version as of 0.22, you need to download
the pack 0.22 manually from the website.
For your concenience, I shortened the links here:

*** WINDOWS: git.io/vKzvx
*** LINUX64: git.io/vKzfU

I'm sorry for the inconvenciences, there has been a lot of internal restructuing going on.
If you got version 0.22 it will be easier again, promised! :)
