IMPORTANT NOTES ON THE UPDATE TO >= 0.14.4
------------------------------------------

To get AllTheHaxx updated to any version after 14.0.1, you need to download
the pack 0.14.3 manually and then replace the executable manually with the
one of 0.14.4; after that, everything should work automatically again.

To keep your pain low, I got the direct download links for you:

 1st step) PACK OF 0.14.3
  * Windows: https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx/releases/download/0.14.3/AllTheHaxx-20160507-win.zip
  * Linux:   https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx/releases/download/0.14.3/AllTheHaxx-20160507-linux-x86_64.tar.xz

 2nd step) EXECUTABLE OF 0.14.4
  * Windows: https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx/releases/download/0.14.4/AllTheHaxx-win-x86.exe
  * Linux:   https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx/releases/download/0.14.4/AllTheHaxx-linux-x86_64
  
I'm sorry for the inconvenciences, there has been a lot of internal restructuing going on.
If you got version 0.14.4 it will be easier again, the autoupdater should do it's job now :)
