|Warning about people selling lua scripts|
I came to hear that these questionable scripts are now given away for free, because
they have a damn RAT in them which allows him to control your client!
(and of course this asshole wants to spread that shit)
Always remember: "If something seems too good to be true, it probably is"

A little update bringing you a bunch of bugfixes (and some features for Lua)
- fixed the bug where you suddenly couldn't click anything anymore
- Made Console copy/cut/paste code a bit nicer
- fixed input freezing after closing the console
- More smooth for emote menu
- better lua error messages
---- lua related stuff ----
Fixes TL;DR: worked towards an approach where lua script wouldn't be able to crash the client anymore,
instead, the client will crash your scripts if they do insane stuff.
- Lua Console commands: !help, !reset and !reload
- Lua Editboxes
- Init lua earlier to prevent crashes with autoload
- Wrappers for all Engine.Graphics: functions; errors with these now throw exceptions instead of crashing
- Kill scripts on oom
And a lot more!
