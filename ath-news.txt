AllTheHaxx news are finally there!

|AllTheHaxx 0.14|
Many things have changed in the next version; the maybe
biggest thing is that we updated the internal DDNet code
to version 10.0.1 which is bringing SDL2 to Teeworlds.

Doesn't matter if you don't know what it does or why
it is something special, but there are a few things
you need to know:

- Update your settings:
   * You may need to lower your mouse sensitivity a bit
   * You may need to rebind some keys, because keynames changed
    
- Special about this update:
  * You can now use the clipboard (CTRL-C, CTRL-V)
  * It is possible to change resolution and fullscreen mode
    without needing to restart
  * On some systems the FPS are more stable (yay!)
