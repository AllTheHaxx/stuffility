|$$Z00About the new StealthMode|
"StealthMode is to AllTheHaxx what botless-version is to bot clients"
When starting your client in stealth mode, it will look to servers as if it was
a vanilla client. Anyhow, it will also behave a bit more like a vanilla client.
Servers won't be able to detect which client you are using and thus can't ban you
for "bot client detected" (shoutout to noby). StealthMode will make it possible
to play on such servers, but there are some sacrifices, too.
Here is an overview about what starting ATH in StealthMode will do:
- Lua will be unavailable (StealthMode replaces the old NoLua version of ATH)
- Zoom will be unavailable except for race servers and spectating
- Other ATH users will not see an 'ATH' over your tee
- Not telling servers about your version might disable some features
There are config variables to change the last two things though:
cl_stealth_force_ath_broadcast - enabling this might get you auto-kicked!
cl_stealth_send_ddnet_version - enable this for optimal compatibility
