|Welcome to our own news page :)|
AllTheHaxx news are finally here!


|AllTheHaxx 0.14.4|
Maaaaaany fixed + updated DDNet to the newest version.

→ ↓ IMPORTANT ↓ ←
Because I was very dumb and forgot some debugging
stuff in the code, you have to download the binary
file manually. I shortened the links for you:

 * WINDOWS.....: git.io/vwj8m
 * LINUX 64 bit: git.io/vwjl5
 
Good news: This issue is fixed in 0.14.4 phew...


|AllTheHaxx 0.14.3|
Please download this release manually from "https://allthehaxx.github.io"!
The Autoupdater won't show it because of internal restructuring.
This version is essential or any further releases.


|AllTheHaxx 0.14|
The SDL2 release.
