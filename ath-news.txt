|Developement pretty much on ice - are we still alive?|
You might have realized that there wasn't a single update in the past three months,
and I'd like to tell you why.
I'm recently pretty busy and have got much less time for coding on teeworlds
related stuff than before. I can't tell for sure how much time will be
invested into ATH for the next time, but for sure there won't be as much progress.
I'm terribly sorry for leaving you all with this not quite finished thing, but it
seems I don't have much of a choice ;(
We'll try to fix the remaining urgent bugs (given that we can manage to find them)
and maybe even release something like a 1.0 at some point.
Who knows, maybe this year 2017 we all got more time to spend...? Although, how
much of your time would you spend on a dying game?
It's pretty discouraging to see teeworlds going under :(
Or to say it with FuroS' words: "Hab voll Stimmungsschwankungen deshalb"


|Warning about people selling lua scripts|
If anybody wants to sell lua scripts to you, DON'T give them your money!
Make sure to contact us first, since there are betrayers around who want you to
pay them for scripts that are freely available from us. ALSO, the scripts you
you would buy from them will probably even be malicious!!
Make sure not to be fooled by such scammers and don't hesitate to talk to us (IRC)!
I can give you almost everything for free that you could buy!
