|Developement pretty much on ice - are we still alive?|
You might have realized that there wasn't a single update in the past month, and
I'd like to tell you why.
I'm recently pretty busy and have got much less time for coding on teeworlds
related stuff than before. I can't tell for sure how much time will be
invested into ATH for the next time, but for sure there won't be as much progress.
I'm terribly sorry for leaving you all with this not quite finished thing, but it
seems I don't have a choice ;(
We'll try to fix the remaining urgend bugs (given that we can manage to find them)
and maybe even release something like a 1.0 as some point.
Who knows, maybe next year I'll have more time to spend again...? Although, how
much of your time would you spend on a dying game?
It's pretty discouraging to see teeworlds going under :(
Or to say it with FuroS' words: "Hab voll Stimmungsschwankungen deshalb"
