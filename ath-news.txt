|AllTheHaxx 0.30 released [09.04.17]|
IMPORTANT: Download a new pack from the website! Replacing the exe won't work!!
It has been another two months since the last update, but here we are again!
Waiting was worth it, there have been 264 commits since 0.29 was released.
Because it's so much, here are only the most significant changes for you:

Important Bugfixes:
- Fixed an incredible number of crashbugs, including many rather old ones
- Fixed UI input locking up after closing the IRC overlay
- If ATH was using a lot of your CPU, write 'default cl_cpu_throttle' in F1

New Features:
- Smooth chat!
- Reworked the crypted chat to use a symmetric cipher (AES-128)
- Added dump_free_keys to show all unbound keys
- Much more (can you spot everything? :P)

Customization:
- Added X-Ray textures (aka entities) to the texture manager
- Font Manager to select fonts + Monospace fonts where appropriate

Consoles:
- Colored F1 console emphasizing on chat
- CTRL-Scroll to change fontsize
- Use CTRL-key shortcuts in the consoles for cool stuff :)
- Added a script-debugger to the lua console
- Made command replay (up/down keys) more intuitive
- Upgraded the lua console a lot

Concerning UI:
- Scrollbars adopt to the listbox length (as usually expected)
- Fixed the emote selection cursor being wrong on windows
- Finally fixed behavior of the server-dependend-configuration interface
- Rejigged the settings GUI a bit (moved stuff from General to Appearance>HUD)

General Improvements:
- Unified cursor control experience in chat, editboxes, console, ...
- Fixed client startup and made it a little bit faster
- Rewrote most of the auto-updater system, making updates safer (for you) and easier (for us)

[ .... ]

Concerning DDNet: this version of AllTheHaxx is at level with 10.4.3
